The `xpkg build` command builds a package file from a local directory of
files. The CLI combines a directory of YAML files and packages them as an
[OCI container image](https://opencontainers.org/), applying the annotations and
values required by the
[Crossplane XPKG specification](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/contributing/specifications/xpkg.md).

`crossplane xpkg build` supports building Configuration, Function, and Provider
package types.

The command recursively looks in `--package-root` for files ending in `.yml` or
`.yaml` and attempts to combine them into a package. All YAML files must be
valid Kubernetes manifests with `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, and `spec`
fields.

## Ignore files

Use `--ignore` to provide a comma-separated list of globs specifying files to
exclude from the build, relative to `--package-root`.

```shell
crossplane xpkg build --ignore="./test/*,kind-config.yaml"
```

## Set the package name

By default, the `build` command constructs the package filename using a
combination of `metadata.name` and a hash of the package contents, and writes it
to `--package-root`. Override the location and filename with `--package-file`
(`-o`):

```shell
crossplane xpkg build -o /home/crossplane/example.xpkg
```

## Include examples

Include YAML files demonstrating how to use the package with `--examples-root`
(`-e`). Defaults to `./examples`.

## Include a runtime image

Function and Provider packages embed a controller container image. Configuration
packages don't have a runtime image.

> **Note:** Images referenced with `--embed-runtime-image` must be in the local
> Docker cache. Use `docker pull` to download a missing image.

Use `--embed-runtime-image-tarball` to embed a local OCI image tarball instead
of an image from the Docker cache.

## Embed an image tag

Use `--tag` (`-t`) to embed an OCI image tag (RepoTag) in the package. This is
useful when using external tools to push the package that expect the tag to be
present in the tarball manifest.

```shell
crossplane xpkg build --tag=registry.example.com/my-org/my-package:v1.0.0
```

## Examples

Build a package from the files in the 'package' directory:

```shell
crossplane xpkg build --package-root=package/
```

Build a Provider package that embeds the controller OCI image so the package can
also run the provider.

```shell
crossplane xpkg build --embed-runtime-image=cc873e13cdc1
```

Build a package with an embedded image tag:

```shell
crossplane xpkg build --tag=xpkg.upbound.io/my-org/my-config:v1.2.3
```
