// DefaultBaseImageCacheDir returns the default per-user cache directory for
// function runtime base image layers. It sits beside the xpkg cache rather
// than inside it, since the two hold different kinds of artifact and are
// pruned on different terms.
//
// Nothing prunes this directory. Layers are keyed by content digest, so
// entries are never stale, but they are also never replaced: every base image
// version a user builds against accumulates, at tens of megabytes per image
// per architecture. Users can delete the directory safely — the next build
// refetches what it needs — but the CLI should grow a retention policy or a
// prune command before this becomes the kind of thing people discover by
// running out of disk.

// tolerantCache degrades to the registry instead of failing the build when the
// cache itself cannot be used.
//
// go-containerregistry's cache is not forgiving on its own. A read error that
// is not ErrNotFound propagates out of Compressed, and the filesystem cache
// creates its backing file lazily, so an unwritable or full cache directory
// surfaces as an error from the layer rather than a cache miss. Neither should
// break a build that could have fetched the layer remotely — especially since
// nothing prunes this cache, which makes a full disk a plausible way to reach
// it. See DefaultBaseImageCacheDir.
//
// One case is not recoverable here: if the directory is writable but fills up
// partway through a layer, the write error surfaces mid-stream, after the
// reader has been handed to the caller. Restarting from the remote layer at
// that point would mean re-reading bytes the caller already consumed.
